It was originally opened in 1910 but when I moved to the North East in 2000 it was in a sorry state of repair and had just closed to the public. In 2018 it was finally reopened after a massive redevelopment project and once again is the jewel in Whitley Bay's crown!\nThis LEGO set has been a pleasure to design, and continues a trend of increasing size of my sets; this one clocks in at around 1,000 pieces and measures 32x18cm (x20 cm high).\nWhilst instantly recognisable to locals, its also possibly my most niche model so far. Therefore I'm taking a different approach to sales. This set is made-to-order. Please allow 2-4 weeks for delivery (though first batch will be shipped late September).\nAs with all my boxed sets, it comes in a high-quality presentation box (which is signed and numbered), a printed booklet and all the parts to complete the build.",
